# Welcome!

Welcome to AIR Kit Documentation ðŸ‘‹

This guide is your go-to resource for everything you need to start building with **AIR Kit** â€” the identity and credentialing toolkit from **Moca Network**.

AIR Kit is composed of two main components:

#### Account SDK

Use this to create and manage user accounts on the Moca Network. This SDK provides the core tools for identity-related functions.

#### Credentials SDK

Use this to issue, verify, and manage **verifiable credentials** for users. Ideal for reputation systems, access control, and other applications.

Head over to [Quickstart ](introduction/quickstart.md)to get started right away, or you can get started with the  sections below:

* [Account SDK](broken-reference) - All the technical information about the SDK and how to integrate the AIR Account.
* [About ](broken-reference)- General information to introduce Mocaverse and the Moca Network

If you encounter any problems, feel free to reach out to your contact point within the Moca Network team.

_Note: Currently, the SDK is still an invite-only private beta. If you are interested, you can sign up through this form_ [_here_](https://mocanetwork.typeform.com/airkitform) _to get the access code._
