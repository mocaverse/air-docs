# Introduction

### What is AIR Credential?

AIR Credential is a decentralized credential management infrastructure built on zero-knowledge proof technology, designed to address challenges in identity verification and privacy protection. It enables decentralized credential issuance, storage, and verification while ensuring user identity privacy. Through standardized credential formats, decentralized storage, and cross-chain verification, AIR Credential provides secure, efficient, and scalable identity management solutions for both users and enterprises.

### Why AIR Credential?

* **Standardized Credential System:** The AIR Credential utilizes schema and Verifiable Credential (VC) designs to create a standardized system for seamless, cross-platform, and cross-chain authentication. It boosts interoperability and scalability across ecosystems.
* **Decentralized Storage and Security:** AIR Credential utilizes decentralized storage to securely store encrypted credentials, raw data, and keys, thereby reducing data breach risks. Even if a storage node is compromised, user data stays protected. It also enables secure credential management across multiple devices for user convenience.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** AIR Credential offers robust encryption and decryption of raw data to protect sensitive information during transmission and storage. The system complies with global privacy regulations while providing secure credential issuance and verification. This comprehensive privacy protection helps enterprises meet regulatory requirements and enhance their data management capabilities.
* **Decentralized Credential Issuance:** AIR Credential offers a decentralized issuance process where user data stays encrypted and private. Using zero-knowledge proof technology, users can verify credentials without revealing sensitive information, providing better security than traditional centralized systems.
* **Innovative Schema Standards:** AIR Credential features an innovative schema standard that enhances scalability and flexibility. This standard supports diverse use cases across industries while allowing schemas to adapt to changing business needs, streamlining enterprise credential management.
* **Zero-Knowledge Proof:** AIR Credential supports identity verification based on **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)**, allowing users to prove their identity without exposing sensitive data. This technology ensures the security of user data and complies with privacy protection regulations, delivering a secure and trustworthy authentication experience.
* **Cross-Chain Verification Capability:** AIR Credential enables cross-chain verification between base Chain and other blockchain networks. Credentials can be verified across multiple chains, with results securely transferred via cross-chain bridges. This allows decentralized applications to easily integrate credential verification across different blockchain ecosystems, improving both compatibility and scalability.
* **Flexible Business Model:** AIR Credential supports a highly flexible business model. Verification fees are dynamically adjusted according to the complexity of the verification logic, ensuring fair and efficient resource utilization. All fees are processed through on-chain transactions, ensuring transparency and traceability. This business model not only meets diverse operational needs but also fosters a sustainable ecosystem for enterprises and individual users.
* **Developer-Friendly Tools:** AIR Credential provides **Issuance Widget SDK** and **Verification Widget SDK**, offering developers user-friendly tools for rapid integration and deployment of credential issuance and verification functions. These tools simplify the development process, reduce technical complexity, and shorten deployment cycles.
