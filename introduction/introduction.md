# Introduction!

This guide is your go-to resource for everything you need to start building with **AIR Kit** ‚Äî the identity and credentialing toolkit from **Moca Network**.

### Your Onboarding Starts Here

From here, we‚Äôll dive into:

* Setting up the AIR Account SDK
* Using the AIR Credential SDK to issue & verify ZK credentials
* Exploring developer examples, guides, and practical working flows.

AIR Kit is composed of two main components:

#### Account SDK:  _Use this to create and manage user accounts on the Moca Network. This SDK provides the core tools for identity-related functions._

#### Credentials SDK: _Use this to issue, verify, and manage **verifiable credentials** for users. Perfect for reputation systems, access control, and more._

Head over to [Quickstart](../account-sdk/quickstart.md) to get started right away, or you can get started with the  sections below:

### **Step 1: Set Up User Login with AIR Account SDK**

The [AIR Account SDK](broken-reference) is your foundation for identity management on the Moca Network. It provides the essential tools to create and manage user accounts securely, offering a seamless and privacy-preserving login experience.

#### **‚úÖ What You Get with AIR Account SDK:**

* **SSO Login:** Implement Single Sign-On, supporting Web3-native smart accounts for a unified user experience across your applications.
* **Persistent User Accounts:** Create and manage user accounts that are designed for privacy and longevity.
* **Session Management:** Robust tools for handling user sessions and authentication.
* **JWT-based APIs:** Leverage industry-standard JSON Web Tokens for secure API interactions.

#### **üöÄ Getting Started with AIR Account SDK:**

This SDK empowers you to manage user accounts on the Moca Network with ease. To begin your journey, follow our detailed developer onboarding guide:

* [Account SDK](broken-reference)  Onboarding Guide: All the technical information about the SDK and how to integrate the AIR Account.
* GitHub Example: Explore practical implementation and best practices in our example repository: [MocaNetwork/airkit-example](https://github.com/MocaNetwork/airkit-example)

### **Steps 2 & 3: Issuing and Verifying Credentials with the AIR Credential SDK**

Imagine a world where you can prove your age without showing your driver's license or confirm your membership in a community without revealing any other personal details. This is the power of **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) based credentials** offered by the AIR Credential SDK. With zero-knowledge credentials, users can prove facts about themselves (like age, membership status, qualifications, or event participation) without revealing the underlying sensitive data.

#### **Key Benefits of ZK-based Credentials:**

* **‚úÖ Reusable:** No need for repeated verification across different platforms or services. Verify once, use multiple times.
* **üåê Portable:** Your credentials are not tied to a single platform or wallet; they travel with the user across various apps, wallets, and ecosystems.
* **üõ°Ô∏è Private:** Share only the absolute minimum information required. Your data remains secure and private.
* **üí∞ Monetizable:** These credentials can power new data markets, allowing users to control and potentially monetize their own verified data, empowering them to stay in control. And also enable monetization channels for data issuers.

#### **Getting Started with Issuance and Verification:**

The AIR Credential SDK provides the tools for both issuing new credentials and verifying existing ones. Refer to this guide to understand the complete user flow and begin integrating:

* **Credentials setup and developer Guide:** [Get started here](../air-credentials/quickstart-guide.md)
* **GitHub Example:** Dive into practical code examples for issuing and verifying: [MocaNetwork/air-credential-example](https://github.com/MocaNetwork/air-credential-example)
