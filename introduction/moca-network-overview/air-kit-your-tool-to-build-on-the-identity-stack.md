# AIR Kit: Your tool to build on the Identity Stack

AIR Kit is the comprehensive toolkit for integrating secure, decentralized identity features into your applications. It's designed to simplify complex concepts like Web3 login, user onboarding, and zero-knowledge proofs, making them accessible for every developer and user.

AIR Kit gives you two powerful SDKs:

1. **AIR Account SDK:** Manage user login, Single Sign-On (SSO), and wallet services.
2. **AIR Credential SDK:** Issue, verify, and consume **ZK-based credentials** that users can carry anywhere.

### What is AIR?

AIR stands for **A**ccount **I**dentity **R**eputation, representing a foundational shift in how users interact with the internet, both in Web2 and Web3. It's a vision for a user-centric digital experience where individuals truly own their assets, identity, and data.

AIR envisions a future where services are built around individuals, rather than individuals conforming to siloed platforms. This means:

* **User Ownership:** Users have ultimate control over their digital assets, identity, and personal data.
* **Common Language of the Internet:** Identity and user data become the shared language, enabling seamless interaction and data exchange between applications.
* **True Network Effects:** Applications building on top of the user-as-root model can achieve genuine network effects, as they can leverage shared user data and identity to provide more comprehensive and valuable experiences.
* **Shared Economics:** A shared economic model incentivizes applications to collaborate, fostering a cooperative ecosystem where services work together for the benefit of the user.

### Who Is This For?

AIR Kit is for anyone building apps/ any platform where **trust, privacy, and user context** matter:

* Founders building consumer-facing apps who want to **skip traditional KYC**
* DAOs need **pseudonymous membership tools**
* Game developers looking to **port player identities and badges across worlds**
* Fintech teams wanting to **verify income, age, or credentials** without storing PII
* AI agents need **verifiable access and behavioral reputation**

### The Big Idea: Identity is the New API Surface

By making identity modular, portable, and verifiable, we unlock entirely new categories of applications.

You’re not just building on Moca, you’re building **with** identity as a primitive.

This isn’t about speculative tech. This is about:

* **Airdrops that reward real participation**
* **Apps that don’t start with zero users**
* **Communities that can grow without re-KYCing everyone**

So, go ahead, plug in the SDK, remix the credentials, and design new experiences.
