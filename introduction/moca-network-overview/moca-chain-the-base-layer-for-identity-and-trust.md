# Moca Chain: The Base Layer for Identity & Trust

Moca Chain is an **EVM-compatible, modular, chain-agnostic** infrastructure Layer 1 optimized for **trustless data onboarding**, **verifiable credentials**, and **user-controlled identity flows**. It’s designed from the ground up to support apps that value privacy, composability, and reputation.

Think of Moca as **the chain where identity becomes infrastructure,** enabling cross-app login, seamless verification, and portable user context.

Here’s what makes Moca different:

* ✅ **Self-sovereign Identity:** Users control their identity keys, not platforms.
* 🔐 **Privacy-preserving Verifications:** Leverage zero-knowledge credentials to prove anything, without revealing everything.
* ♻️ **Reusable Data:** Onboard once, reuse everywhere. Credentials live _with the user_, not inside your app.
* 🧬 **Interoperability by Design:** Use Moca Chain to anchor identity proofs that work across ecosystems, from DeFi to DAOs to gaming.
* 🚀 **Chain-Agnostic Architecture:** Build on Moca, verify anywhere. Moca isn’t about locking you in; it’s about freeing you up.

> In essence: Moca Chain is your identity layer for Web3 and beyond.
