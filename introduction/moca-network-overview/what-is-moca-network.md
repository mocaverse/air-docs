# What is Moca Network?

Moca Network **reimagines digital identity as a unified, self-sovereign, and privacy-preserving asset** that users control and own across all their online and offline interactions.

* Identity is no longer a byproduct of each app, but **the root of the internet experience**.
* Users can present proofs about themselves, such as age, qualifications, and memberships, **without ever revealing sensitive raw data**.
* Developers and founders can build seamless, interoperable apps where identity is a first-class citizen.

> Building on Moca = contributing to a more open, secure, and user-empowered digital world.

### What Comprises the Moca Network?

Moca Network = Moca Chain + AIR Kit

At the heart of Moca Network is a powerful belief: **identity should not be fragmented, siloed, or extracted â€” it should be owned, portable, and foundational** to every interaction in the digital world. Moca Network is the technical and philosophical framework that makes this possible, powered by two core components: **Moca Chain** and **AIR Kit**.
