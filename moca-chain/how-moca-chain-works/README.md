# How Moca Chain works

The Moca Chain utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, based on Tendermint consensus, to ensure network security. This consensus mechanism ensures network security while providing efficient block generation. On the Moca Chain, blocks are generated by a group of validators every 2 seconds, ensuring fast confirmation and processing of transactions.\
In the Moca Chain ecosystem, the Moca token serves as both the gas and governance token. As a gas token, Moca is used to pay for transaction fees and smart contract execution costs on the network. As a governance token, Moca holders can participate in the governance and decision-making process of the blockchain, promoting the decentralized development of the network.



## Validators on the Moca Chain

Validators on the Moca Chain play a crucial role in the network's security and reliability; however, their responsibilities extend beyond these core functions. Here are the key duties and functions of validators within the Moca Chain network.

## **Cross-Chain Event Consensus and Data Packet Relaying**

Validators are responsible for reaching consensus on cross-chain events and relaying cross-chain data packets to other blockchains. This responsibility ensures the fast and secure execution of cross-chain transactions while minimizing costs. By verifying and relaying cross-chain data, validators lay the foundation for interoperability between different blockchains.

## **Ensuring Data Integrity and Availability**

Validators play an important role in ensuring the integrity and availability of data provided by Moca Chain Data Service Providers (MDSPs). They can challenge the availability of the data provided by service providers, either specifically or randoml,y to detect potential malicious actors or underperforming providers. For such actors, validators can impose appropriate penalties, such as slashing their stakes, thereby maintaining the quality and reliability of services within the Moca Chain ecosystem.

## **Participation in Network Governance**

Validators also play a key role in network governance. They participate in deciding the future direction of the Moca Chain ecosystem by voting, and they can adjust various network parameters as needed. Through this process, validators ensure the long-term health and sustainable development of the network, while also responding flexibly to the changing demands and requirements of users.
