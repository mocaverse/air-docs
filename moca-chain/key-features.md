# Key Features

As a decentralized storage network, Moca Chain provides a rich set of features and playability. Here is a list of key features and their development status on Moca Chain:

## Moca Chain Components

The Moca Chain comprises three key components that collaboratively enhance digital identity management and data storage within the web3 ecosystem:

* **Moca Chain with EVM Compatibility**: Built on the Cosmos/Tendermint framework, Moca Chain provides a high-performance and secure blockchain infrastructure. It supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility through Evmos, allowing developers to deploy and interact with Ethereum smart contracts effortlessly. The chain manages user accounts, Moca token balances, and metadata for its object storage system, facilitating robust state management and enabling multi-chain DApps.
* **Moca Chain Data Storage Provider (MDSP)**: MDSPs are infrastructure providers responsible for storing actual data objects while collaborating with Moca Chain validators to maintain metadata and financial ledgers. By offering APIs similar to Amazon S3, MDSPs enable users and DApps to efficiently upload, download, and manage data. They ensure data redundancy, maintain strong network connections through local nodes, and uphold high-quality service standards through community engagement and governance procedures.

Together, these components create a comprehensive and privacy-focused framework for managing digital identities and data storage in a decentralized web3 environment.
